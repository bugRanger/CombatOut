This simple addon is written for the game version 1.12. 
Its purpose is to display the time before leaving the battle. This will be useful for classes for which it really matters, warriors and rogues.

1. Debug mode with latancy counting.
2. Combat progress bar (6 seconds until combat exit)

### Known issues
The current countdown does not take into account your latency to the server, so the bar may end before you leave the combat.
